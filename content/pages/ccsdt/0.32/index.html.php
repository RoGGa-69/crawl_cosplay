<p>The Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Tournament (CCSTD) is a competition that aims to fill a
Crawl niche not currently filled by the version release tournament and the other 3 Crawl Cosplay initiatives.
The idea is for players to compete by trying to do as well as possible in a
game of Crawl with one attempt only; if you die, that week's challenge is over (thus
"sudden death". This competition is a lower time commitment event that aims to challenge players while
simultaneously encouraging unusual characters and play styles that you might not normally consider.</p>

<h2>Competition Format</h2>

<ul>
<li>Each challenge consists of playing a randomly chosen Crawl combo.</li>
<li>You get <em>one</em> attempt to play each combo.</li>
<li>The goal is to advance as far as possible (and win!) in each game, scoring
points by reaching various in-game milestones.</li>
<li>Only games played and milestones scored between 00:00 UTC on the start and end dates count.</li>
<li>Details on rules and scoring are available on the <a
href="rules.html">rules page</a>.</li>
</ul>
