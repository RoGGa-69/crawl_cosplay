<h2 style="color:rgb(69, 136, 5);">About Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Tournament (CCSDT)</h2>

<p>The Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Tournament is a competition that aims to fill a
Crawl niche not currently filled by the biannual version release tournaments or other Crawl Cosplays.
The idea is for players to compete by trying to do as well as possible in a
game of Crawl with one attempt only; if you die, that challenge is over (thus
"sudden death", though you may&mdash;<em>will</em>&mdash;also die suddenly). This competition is
a lower time commitment event that aims to challenge players while playing one of the 100 or so Crawl Unique characters.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each challenge consists of playing a randomly chosen Crawl Unqiue's combo
(e.g. Snorg, a TrBe). The combo for each week of the competition will be announced at
00:00 UTC on the Friday starting that week. All players have one week to
finish a game using that combo. Only milestones recorded during the week (from
00:00 UTC on the start date until 23:59 UTC on the end date) will count for
scoring.</li>
<li>Your first 0.32 game started on an official server during the week will count
for scoring. This is the only allowed attempt, subject to rule 3 below.</li>
<li>One redo per week is allowed if your first game ended in death with player
XL < 5 (i.e., no redo once you hit XL 5). The redo game must be started after
the end of the first game (no startscumming!).  The highest CSDC score of the
two games is counted towards your score.</li>
<li>Each challenge has an optional bonus challenge in addition to the
race/class combo. Each bonus will have two tiers; the second tier is more
difficult and worth more points.</li>
<li>Each challenge includes a list of gods. A bonus point can be earned upon
reaching ****** piety (or on worship with Gozag or Xom) with one of the listed
gods. The point is lost if you ever abandon your god or are excommunicated. If
the combo for the week is a zealot background, god points are only for sticking
with the starting god. If the combo for the week is a demigod, the god point is automatically awarded.</li>
<li>The season consists of 5 challenges total (i.e., 5 different combos). Each
race and background will be selected at most once during the competition.</li>
<li>The final rankings will be tallied at the end of week 5 and represent the
final outcome. The player with the highest CSDC score is the champion.</li>
<li>Tiebreakers are (in order): number of weekly bonus points, highest in-game
score.</li>
<li>Don't play on more than one account. That misses the point.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>Scoring is divided into two parts, weekly points assigned to each game
played, and one-time points awarded once per season regardless of how many
games achieve them.</p>

<table class="info"><tr class="head"><th>Weekly points (can be earned each
week)</th><th></th></tr>

<tr class="head" id="onetime"><th>One-time points (earned once in the

<tr><td class="name">Get a rune without using potions or scrolls:</td><td class="pt">6</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="notes"> It will not always be the case that earning a
Tier II bonus implies that you have earned a Tier I bonus, these points can be
awarded separately. Unless specified, a bonus or one time point does not
require you to win to earn the point.</p>
